                    <p>Part of providing an excellent service is being there when the client needs you. This is important to us so if you’re stuck working late and need our assistance we’ll be there for you. We’re also passionate about working smart so it is not uncommon for us to create custom solutions based on individual client needs. If you need forms, landing pages or integration with your systems API we can facilitate that for you.</p>

                    <p>We don't like to boast but when it comes to speed we have to admit we're the fastest. We have experienced, highly efficient coders and they allow us to turn jobs around in record time. If you have a rush job that needs coding, we can do it. No problem. As we mentioned, we like to work smart so create custom scripts and procedures for all our clients. This means the work we do for you only gets faster.</p>

                    <p>There is no standard approach to providing a solution. Every business is unique and the people we work with are as individual as their customers. Understanding this is key to the work we do, whether it be an email marketing strategy, design or writing compelling copy.</p>

What makes us different is how much we care. We always go above and beyond and will endeavour to be as available as possible.</p>

                    <h4>Handcrafted code and personal account management</h4>
                    <p>HTML for email has always been different to that for the web. It’s why we have always built emails for our clients from the ground up - editors add unnecessary code which can affect how the email looks as well as how well it delivers. As with all things Internet, coding doesn’t stand still and our team are at the front of the curve - particularly when it comes to responsive code to ensure your emails are as engaging as possible whatever device people view them on. We adopt the same approach to account management. If you work with us you should expect to benefit from our knowledge. We work closely with all our clients and are as individual as you are.</p>
